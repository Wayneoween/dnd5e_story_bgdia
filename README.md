## A D&D Blog from some people from Augsburg

The purpose of this Blog is to keep track on the adventures me and my players life and die through.
This useses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and the fact that GitHub can render this to html out of the box.

The Theme we use is [this](https://github.com/iwiedenm/jekyll-theme-massively-src/) but has quite a few modifications.
We removed the `Formspring.io` integrations since it [seems not to be alive anymore](https://techcrunch.com/2013/03/15/formspring-the-pioneering-anonymous-qa-platform-is-shutting-down/) and we didn't want forms anyway.
[Disqus](https://disqus.com) also was removed, since we don't want comments on that page and you can mail me or join our Slack!
